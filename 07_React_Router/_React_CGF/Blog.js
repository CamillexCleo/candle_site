      <h4>My Web Development Experience</h4>
      <p>
        My web developement experience has came a long away. I originally set
        out to learn full-stack developement. Once I began a Udemy course by
        Angela Wu, I was hooked. I've made numerous of applications & small
        websites with HTML, CSS, & now JavaScript. I am excited to expand my
        knowledge & discover animations eventually.

      <h4>Database Design</h4>
      <p>
        Since my website is all about candles, I will include a database that
        has all the info about the candle names, candle types, candles sizes,
        fragrances, & date is was poured. Click{" "}
        <a href="docs/candles.json">here</a> to see my JSON file.

      <h4>Database Experience</h4>
      <p>
        Last semester, I took my first database management course. So, I have a
        little bit of experiece working with raw data. We covered data modeling
        concepts, various file management techniques, data definition &
        manipulation using SQL. In the end, we created a mini database for a
        fictional gaming company. Very tedious! I wouldn't survive as a data
        scientist lol

      <h4>HomePage HW Blog</h4>
      <p>
        The homework assignment was fairly simple. The biggest thing I struggled
        with was the data inside of the JSON file.

      <h4>JS SPA Blog</h4>
      <p>
        I recall the professor saying the that this HW assignment would be
        easier than the Lab. In my opinion it was the other way around. I got
        through software injection with ease before but for some reason I
        struggled to get my program to work this time around.{" "}

      <h4>Homework 03 Blog</h4>
      <p>
        I attempted to complete the homework assignment before doing the Lab &
        that was a bad idea! After doing the Lab, I felt pretty prepared to
        complete this homework. I appreciate how straight forward it was. The
        biggest thing I struggled with was the styling.{" "}

      <h4>Homework 05 Blog</h4>
      <p>
        This homework assignment was a little difficult for me because of my previous issues with Homework 3. For some reason, my 
        reuseable javascript code was working for homework 3 but wasn't for homework 5. After looking into it, I realized that it was calling 
        wrong Content Generating Function which is why it was not rending. Besides that the assignment was simple. {" "}

      <h4>Homework 07 Blog</h4>
      <p>
        As simple as this assigment sounded, it was very difficult & time consuming. I would assume it is because I did not complete the lab 
        assigment. I believe another reason it took me some time is because I wanted to take my time & understand each line since I was
        not already exposes to the reusable select, radio, & validation functions. Once I got through understanding everything it became simple.{" "}
